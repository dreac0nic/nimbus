Nimbus
======

This is the actual official 100% legit real-deal repo for the Nimbus (working title) game project.

Version 0.1
-----------

The first version of the basic framework illustrates a possible way we could set up the engine.
This base framework was made in anticipation of the rest of the game's class structure. Thus,
the base framework itself does little more than initialize the Ogre::Root. SceneManager creation
and input handling should be relegated to the RunMode.

This framework will continue to be incomplete until more of the classes from our software architecture
are added. In order to see if it will work, it should be expanded to include some of these. If another
base framework shows more promise, this approach may be abandoned because it will not be apparent
if the approach is working until later in the development of the framework.
