Version 0.2
-----------

The second version of the basic framework is our implementation of our choice of engine design.
This base framework was made in anticipation of the rest of the game's class structure. Thus,
there are still several more managers and other components that still need to be created /
implemented (such as the audio framework and environment manager).

This framework will continue to be incomplete until more of the classes from our software
architecture are added. However, even in its current form, it acts as the basis for all of these
other systems in the game.
